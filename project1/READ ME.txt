Plan:

For this project we have to make it possible to simplify black scholes processes
by desactivating some time dependent variables to gain computation speed.

We create constantblacksholesprocess a copy of blackscholesprocess that will handle the simplified operation.
In constantblacksholesprocess We modify dividendTS riskRate and the functions drift by replacing fowardRate by zeroRate.
We also disable the update of localVolatility().

We also modify mceuropeanengine by adding a boolean wich allow the user to choose between the two processes and rewrite je pathgeneration.
we add an if/else statement following this boolean wich will create differents pathgenerator.


Question:
are we supposed to consider the case of Strike-dependent Volatility ? 
In our case (constant volatility) the black-volatility is equal to the local volatility?
zeroRate (time t, arg) = zeroRate (Date & d, Date d1 , args ) ? what is the difference? 
Are we supposed to keep all the specific models (GarmanKohlagenProcess, BlackProcess ..) ? 
what does the RegisterWith do ?
